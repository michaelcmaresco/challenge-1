# challenge-1

This module 1 assignment served to help refactor a webpage that needed to have it's accessibility/semantic elements updated.

Upon viewing the refactored code, we will see
  - Semantic HTML elements
  - Elements following a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
  - When viewing the image elements, we see accessible alt attributes falling in sequential order.
  - A working concise, descriptive title element. 
  
  Accessibility is extremely important for people with disabilities to have use of Websites/ HTML pages. Through this accessibility
  a website will be easier to navigate with some with disabilities. 
  
  ALSO, with better semantic element placement in an HTML page, a HTML page will be better found through search engines like google, bing, etc.
